📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, processing, and visualizing student academic performance data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
The dataset contains missing values, invalid marks, and duplicates, which are handled using proper data-cleaning techniques.
After cleaning, meaningful insights are generated through multiple visualizations.

🎯 Objectives

• Clean real-world student result data
• Handle missing, invalid, and duplicate records
• Calculate total marks and assign grades
• Analyze academic performance using visualizations
• Build a professional Matplotlib dashboard

🛠️ Technologies Used

1) Python
2) Pandas – data manipulation & cleaning
3) NumPy – numerical operations
4) Matplotlib – data visualization
5) Excel – input & output data storage


🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

1) Filled missing Name and Class values
2) Restricted marks to a valid range (0–100)
3) Replaced missing numeric values with 0
4) Removed duplicate records
5) Created a new column Total_Marks
6) Assigned grades based on total marks


📊 Visualizations Included

The project generates a 2×2 Matplotlib dashboard:

• Grade Distribution (Pie Chart)
- Shows overall student performance distribution

• Average Marks per Subject (Bar Chart)
- Identifies subject-wise difficulty

• Attendance vs Total Marks (Scatter Plot)
- Analyzes correlation between attendance and performance

• Top 5 Students (Bar Chart)
- Highlights high-performing students

📈 Sample Insights

• Subjects with lower average marks need improvement
• Higher attendance generally leads to better performance
• Clear identification of top-performing students
• Grade distribution provides quick academic overview

📤 Output Files

• Cleaned Dataset: Cleaned_Student_Data.xlsx
• Visual Dashboard: Displayed using Matplotlib
