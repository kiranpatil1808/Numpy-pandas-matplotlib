📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing employee data using Python.
The dataset contains missing values and duplicate records, which are handled using Pandas and NumPy, followed by meaningful data visualizations using Matplotlib to extract business insights.

The project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow, making it suitable for academic submission, GitHub portfolio, and beginner–intermediate data analyst roles.

🎯 Objectives

• Clean raw employee data with missing and duplicate values
• Perform statistical analysis on salary and employee distribution
• Visualize key insights using multiple charts
• Build a structured and readable data analysis project

🛠️ Technologies Used

1) Python 3
2) Pandas – data manipulation and analysis
3) NumPy – numerical operations
4) Matplotlib – data visualization
5) Excel (.xlsx) – input data format


🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

1) Replaced missing categorical values with "N/A"
2) Filled missing numerical values using mean
3) Removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity

📈 Data Analysis Performed

• Average, minimum, and maximum salary calculation
• Department-wise employee count
• Department-wise average salary
• City-wise employee distribution
• Identification of top 5 highest-paid employees

📊 Data Visualizations

The project includes a 2×2 subplot dashboard:
• Employee Distribution per Department (Pie Chart)
• Average Salary per Department (Horizontal Bar Chart)
• Employees per City (Horizontal Bar Chart)
• Salary Distribution (Histogram)
These visualizations help in understanding workforce distribution and salary patterns effectively.
