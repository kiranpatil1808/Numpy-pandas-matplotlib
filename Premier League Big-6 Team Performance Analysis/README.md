📌 Project Overview

This project performs football performance analysis for the Premier League Big-6 teams using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and mplsoccer. It analyzes
player and team-level metrics such as goals,assists, minutes played, passing efficiency, shot locations, and average positions.
The same analytical pipeline is reused across six teams, demonstrating scalable data analysis and visualization.

🏟️ Teams Analyzed

• Arsenal
• Manchester City
• Manchester United
• Chelsea
• Liverpool
• Tottenham Hotspur


📊 Features & Visualizations 


🔹 Squad Composition
- Pie chart showing distribution of positions (GK, DEF, MID, FWD)

🔹 Player Usage
- Top 5 players by minutes played
- Identifies most trusted players

🔹 Attacking Output
- Top 5 goal scorers
- Top 5 players by Goals + Assists (G+A)

🔹 Goal Conversion Analysis
- Goal conversion rate = Goals / Shots on Target
- Handles NaN and Infinity values correctly

🔹 Playmaker Analysis
- Scatter plot of Pass Accuracy vs Total Passes
- Highlights creative and high-volume passers

🔹 Shot Map
- Shot locations plotted on a StatsBomb pitch
- Visualizes attacking zones

🔹 Average Position Heatmap
- KDE heatmap of average on-ball positions
- Shows tactical shape & team dominance

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

• Data cleaning & preprocessing
• Feature engineering (G+A, conversion rate)
• Reusable & modular Python functions
• Sports data visualization
• Tactical football insights
• Scalable analytics pipeline


🛠️ Technologies Used

1) Python 3
2) Pandas
3) NumPy
4) Matplotlib
5) mplsoccer


📈 Data Notes

• Player statistics are realistic sample-based values
• Shot and positional coordinates follow StatsBomb pitch dimensions
• This project is intended for analysis, visualization, and learning, not official scouting use

🎯 Use Cases

• Sports analytics portfolio
• Football data visualization
• Academic projects
• Interview demonstrations
• Data storytelling

🚀 Future Improvements

• Per-90 metrics (Goals/90, Assists/90)
• xG / xA integration
• Team comparison dashboards
• Radar charts for player profiles
• Automated plot saving
• Interactive dashboards (Plotly / Streamlit)
